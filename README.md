## Database Design & Implement

This class uses Python and SQLite3 to learn how to create databases more effectively. We also learned less-computerized techniques such as creating ER-Diagrams and Relational Schema by hand.

I created this repository to archive my final project progress though it is a little late into the semester...

I am a beginner in using Linux and terminal environments so **project.sh** is just a little shortcut for myself. No guarantee it'll work for everyone.
